  <h2><span class="driven">What's this about?</span></h2> 
    <p class="intro-description">I’d like to think a number of qualities describe who I am: thoughtful, curious, driven, respectful, conscientious, competitive, and principled. I identify myself by: loving my girlfriend and wanting a family with her someday; living in Chicago; advocating Indiana University and cheering for its sports teams; reading Daniel Pink; laughing at my best friend’s improv shows; and learning about tech startups.</p>
    <p class="intro-description">I'd love the opportunity work with others to create great things with real soial value, and I always want to feel inspired to build.</p>
    <p class="intro-description">I joined The Starter League seeking four things: Problem Solving, Transparency, Community, Happiness.</p>

<div class="background-overview"> 
  <h2><span class="driven">What I've Done.</span></h2>
  <p class="intro-description">I graduated from Indiana University, Kelley School of Business in May, 2005. There, I studied Entreprenuership because I wanted to be a pioneer, an innovator.</p>
  <p class="intro-description">My first sustainable professional experience was at First American Bank, where I started in September, 2006. I did a lot there and had a ton of oppotunity to work with smart, accomplished people, but I stuggled finding what I wanted to do with my life. I finally got the oppotunity to build a social media program for the organization, and I became pretty obsessed with all things digitial. A career was finally born. I was 28.</p>
  <p class="intro-description">I know work at a really awesome search marketing agency, iProspect. The people are super smart and the culture is super fun. The work is challenging and my client is a giant.</p>
