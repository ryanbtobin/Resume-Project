<h2>What's This About?</h2>

<p class="standard-paragraph">I’d like to think a number of qualities describe who I am: thoughtful, curious, driven, respectful, conscientious, competitive, and principled. I identify myself by: loving my girlfriend and wanting a family with her someday; living in Chicago; advocating Indiana University and cheering for its sports teams; reading Daniel Pink; laughing at my best friend’s improv shows; and learning about tech startups.</p>

<p class="standard-paragraph">I'm looking forward to working with really smart, really passionate people.</p>

<h2>What I've Done.</h2>

<p class="standard-paragraph">I graduated from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in May 2005. I studied Entrepreneurship because I always appreciated the piorneering and innovation of start-ups. Someday, that would be me. Instead, for the majority of my 20s, I worked at a regional financial institution in Chicago called First American Bank, where I did a number of things, really. I never had a career until I has the opportunity to build a social media program for the organization. I fell in love with all things digital and a career was born.</p>

<p class="standard-paragraph">I currently working for an awesome digital performance marketing agency called iProspect, where I focus on search marketing. The people are brilliant, the culture is fun, and the client is a giant. Life is good.</p>
