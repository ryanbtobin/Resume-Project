	<h2 class="entry-title">Why Starter League?</h2>
	<h5 class="authorship">By Ryan on March 1st, 2012</h5>

	<p class="standard-paragraph">I graduated from the Indiana University's Kelley School of Business with a BS in Entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship was my choice because I believed mostly in small business. The teachers, the facility, the curriculum was second to none when it comes to undergraduate business schools - of course, I'll always appreciate my time at IU. When I was there, however, something didn't click with me. I wanted to be surrounded by people that were interested in discovery, people that wanted to solve real problems with innovation. I didn’t want to just make a dollar, I wanted to think about issues and solve real problems. When I attended Starter League’s most recent open house, the consistent theme in the panel discussion was problem solving. Problem solving.</p>

	<p class="standard-paragraph">For most of my 20s, I was lost. I had no idea what I wanted to be. I worked at a regional financial institution, where people were very content doing what they did every day – I was not. I couldn’t buy into the company’s core mission. To be completely honest, the consistent tactic was to be less transparent until regulators told us to be better. Loan papers were super documents and we raced through them at signing, telling ourselves that the customer probably did their research ahead of time. Even checking account agreements were written in 4 pt. font with line after line of mostly meaningless dribble. I committed myself to build a social media program there, and so I did. I told C-Suite that it was cheap, efficient channel to tell prospect customers about products and service – which, of course, it is. My personal agenda was to give a customer a public space to ask real questions and get them answered. The more we get honest people to leverage the web, the more truth will be accessible. Transparency.</p>

	<p class="standard-paragraph">I’m now in digital marketing – working for a great search agency, iProspect. Of all the companies in Chicago, my client is arguably the most ingrained in the city’s history. I really like the work, and I really love the culture of iProspect. They care about their employees, they concern themselves in doing what is right, and they love innovation. iProspect believes in community and sharing. It feels amazing to be at place where so many people want to help you. It makes you want to make more connections. Starter League (and 1871) is clearly an outstanding community. I would be honored to contribute to it in any way possible. Community.</p>

	<p class="standard-paragraph">I made it through my 20s, and I’m happy in my current job. Now what? I want to be better! Understanding HTML/CSS will make me better. I’ll understand the core concepts of this space where I spend so much time, and I’ll be better at connecting people with my client. Will I start the next great Chicago startup? Maybe and it would be amazing. I will, though, definitely be better at my job, and I’ll be an even happier person. Happiness.</p>
